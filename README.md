**Overview:**
Using a third-party API, I was able to create a weather dashboard that anyone can use to search the weather in various cities. Results will include the current date, temperature, humidity, wind, and UV index for the city searched. On top of that, it will pull up the city's five day forecast. Search history is stored on the side of the page so the user can move easily between cities to compare weather. Upon reload of the webpage, the site will load the last searched city's information.


**The following tasks were done to meet the needs of the project:**
* Utilized OpenWeatherMap - a third party API to receive current conditions and forecasts for searched cities
* Made AJAX calls to retreive data from Open Weather Map that were used to fill the page 
* Incorporated localstorage to save users information on reload
* Applied Materialize for modern, responsive front-end framework
* Added dynamic html elements through use of jQuery
* Filled page with some extra pizzazz using CSS and GoogleFonts

### **Technologies Used:**
